% Question a.
% Question i.
%1. true.
%2. false. 'bread' = bread
%8. true if X = bread
%9. true if X = sausage, Y = bread
%14. false.

% Question ii.
% when an attempt at unification is made, prolog looks trough the knowledge base for an instantiation of that value
% when it hits an instantiation, it recursively searches for what those conditions resolve to.

% Question b.
% Yes, because the conditions of a clause may need to be unified with constants to resolve.

% Question c.
% Yes, prolog proves two expressions unify by proving that there is no fact that contradicts the conjecture.
