Datasets I could use include https://old.datahub.io/dataset/collection-of-facial-images\nwhich has sets of faces where the subject is doing different things to increase variability.\n Another dataset I could use might include one  a user on reddit posted a large database of pictures scraped from tinder. Another dataset on kaggle also labled pictues with race, gender and emotion, so I could try training with those variables as well.\n Success would be a model which could tell, given a picture, if that picture was a picture of a the person it's supposed to be of with an accuracy of 95%. \n I would use convolutional neural nets using the keras Conv2D layers and MaxPool layers. Difficulties might include reconizing faces from different angles or with different expressions",
