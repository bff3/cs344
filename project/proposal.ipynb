They use eigenfaces, or a principle component analysis of the images\n    to reduce the computational complexity of training. This experiment also uses the triplet loss function which uses\n    an anchor feature, a positive match feature, and a negative feature. The triplet loss function is used for face verification. The advantage of using\n    triplet loss is that it increases the embedding distance between faces, while keeping the same face close together. They\n    use Stochastic gradient decent and AdaGrad for the optimizers. For their core architectures, they use Zeiler\u0026Fergus\n    style deep architecture which is 22 layers deep. They also use Inception-style model, which uses optimized local\n    architecture construction and repeats it spatially (Going deeper with convolutions). Keras has more recent\n    implimentations of this called InceptionV3.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    FaceNet used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces for their datasets. Youtube Faces uses pairs of labeled\n    instead of pairs of still pictures. LFW is available through scikit learn.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n    I plan to use Keras for much of the implimentation of the FaceNet methods. I plan to compare the use of InceptionV3\n    and Inception-ResNet-v2.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n",
