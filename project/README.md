This project intends to explore the [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) (LFW) dataset
for facial recognition (face to name mapping) and the [Inception v3](https://keras.io/applications/#inceptionv3) deep neural net. Two other categorization 
methods were tried on the dataset. The network used for the in-class MNIST categorization example, and 
a SciKit Learn example using a SVM was compared to the results from the inception network.
