Hill Climbing
  - 1000 data points
  - Delta = 0.1
    - Avg time hill climbing: 0.01730513000488281
    - direct linear correlation with start value distance to solution
      and time to find solution
  - for Delta = 5.0
    - Average = 0.00034482002258300
Simulated Annealing
  - 1000 data points
  - Delta = 0.1
    - Average time simulated annealing: 0.00512291288375854
    - no correlation between start point and time to solve
  - Delta = 5.0
    - Average time to complete = 0.00505076980590820

2.1
  a.
    Both solve the problem well
  b.
    The hill climbing algorithm can be faster if the initial value is close
    to the solution or if the Delta is higher. The simulated_annealing algorithm
    had an average time to solve of 0.005(ms?) regardless of the Delta value
  c.
    The starting value effected the time to solve for the hill climbing algorithm
    but not the simulated annealing
  d.
    Changing the delta has no affect on simulated annealing but increasing the delta
    causes an increase in solution speed for the hill Climbing. This is because
    Delta determines how many steps the hill climbing algorithm has to take to get
    to the solution. Because the SA algorithm has probabilistic movement determined
    by the exponential function, the cooling period determines the solution time
    more than the step size in this case anyway.
  e.
    The exp schedule determines the nature of the exponential curve which describes
    the rate at which the SA algorithm "cools" or how the probabilistic moves become
    less extreme.

2.2
  a. & b.
    The hill climbing algorithm only finds the local maxima "up-hill" from
    the initial value. The simulated annealing algorithm's success partly depends
    on it's starting spot, however it seems to jump sometimes between the humps
    of the function, out-performing the hill-climbing algorithm.
  c.
    A very small step size impeded the SA algorithm because it couldn't jump
    between humps as easy. The hill-climbing benefited slightly from a larger delta,
    but ultimately if the initial point was well within the hump, it would stay there.
  d.
    Absolute max and min are 29.8 and 0.0 respectively.


2.4
  a.
    Simulated annealing because hill-climbing will always pick the best local
    solution but SA sometimes chooses poorer solutions.
  b.
    since each solution is a float you could store something on the order of
    2*2^30 â€“ 8*2^30 solutions. <Time to execute though>
  c.
