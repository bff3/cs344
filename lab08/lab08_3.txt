a.
seaborn extends Matplotlib, seaborn makes styling easier and displaying statistical data in different formats.
Matplotlib is a good basic plotting tool which can do more complicated plots, bot not easily.

b.
this set has 397 examples which should be enough considering this is a predictive model not a categorization model.
The data looks to be of good quality without very many outliers.

c.
it sets the same range for each variable, thereby increasing the chances of convergence.

d.
no this is a sequential model which is a linear stack of layers.

e.
yes, because larger networks may overfit to the peculiarities of a dataset, and smaller networks don't have the excess
perceptrons to learn the specific characteristics of that training set.
