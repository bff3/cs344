    "1. There are two issues with modeling AI from human cognition. The first is that computers as they are known to modern computer science, are constructed much differently that the human brain by dint of structrure. The second issue is that one would like AI to outperform the human mind rather than just keep pace. A further issue is that we ourselves barely know anything about how the human mind works so how can we model AI after something we don't fully understand?"
